# Reinforcement Learning Coursework Repository

This repository contains my implementations and experiments for several Reinforcement Learning (RL) homework assignments. Each folder corresponds to a different assignment and includes code, reports, and experiment results using popular RL algorithms and Gymnasium environments.

---

## RL-HW2
- **RL_PHW2_DQN.ipynb** — Train a DQN agent on **LunarLander-v2**.  
- **RL_PHW2_MC_TD.ipynb** — Apply MC and TD value-based methods on **CliffWalking-v0**.  
- **greedy_policy.mp4** — Demo of the greedy policy.

---

## RL-HW3
- **RL_HW3.pdf** — Assignment report.  
- **RL_HW3_On_Policy.ipynb** — Implement and test **REINFORCE** and **PPO** (on-policy algorithms).

---

## RL-HW4
- **RL_HW4.ipynb** — Implement **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** on **CartPole**, both online and offline, plus behavioral cloning from expert trajectories.
